To what extent is the Information, Library and Archival Science community taking Machine Learning (ML) at face value ? ML methods and tools for the classification, clustering and indexing of documents have demonstrated tangible results within cultural heritage institutions. As traditional indexing and cataloging practices are increasingly pushed into a corner, reducing them to the luxury domain of "boutique metadata", the rise of ML techniques to face operational challenges has been welcomed. However, how do we as a research community assess the quality of the outcomes of both supervised and unsupervised ML ?

This website wishes to offer a platform to share case-study based research within the Information, Library and Archival Science community. As underlined by for example Andr√© Vellino (2016) and Anne J. Gilliland (2017), there is an increasing need to work with dirty" real-life document sets instead of sterile, cleaned and marked up test sets which are traditionally used for benchmarking purposes. Over the next few months, this website will aggregate a set of varying case-studies, for which both the research paper, the method and tools alongside the source data will be made available as open data.
