We have reached the maximum capacity of 50 people. This relatively small format was chosen to keep the hands-on part manageable and to ensure space for discussion. If you have registered and canâ€™t come, please let us know so that we can give your seat to someone else. We will have a diverse crowd of researchers and practitioners from both public and private organisations. See you on the 31st of May!
