            <h3>What you need to prepare</h3>
            <span class="text-left animated hiding" data-animation="fadeInUp" data-delay="0">
<p>The morning session is based on the assumption that you bring your own laptop on which you pre-install some software and download the data with which we will work. This page summarises everything you need to know to prepare for the workshop.</p> 

<h5>Hardware requirements:</h5>

<ul>
<li>Please ensure your laptop has a minimum of 2Gb of RAM and at least 3Gb of available storage space. </li>

<li>Make sure that you have an updated version of Java - the last version of Java SDK can be downloaded <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">HERE</a>. </li>
</ul>

<h5>Sofwares requirements:</h5>

<p>Both morning workshops require that you download a total of <b>four files</b>: a corpus sample, a word vector model and two software packages. The software in question does not require installation and can therefore be used without an administrator account on the computer. They work on any operating system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0.5em">During the entire morning session, weâ€™ll work with a subset of the EC archive corpus, which can be downloaded here:</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="">Sample Corpus</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h6 style="margin-left:0.5em">For the first hands-on (Using topic modelling & word embeddings):</h6>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/download.php">Mallet</a>.</li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/mmihaltz/word2vec-GoogleNews-vectors">Word2Vec Google News vectors</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h6 style="margin-left:0.5em">For the second hands-on (supervised machine learning):</h6>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/language-technologies/jrc-eurovoc-indexer">JEX (JRC Eurovoc Indexer)</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Detailed instructions will be handed out during the workshop for each step of the process, so apart from downloading the softwares and the test data, no other preparation is required.</p>

<p>Support: if you have trouble installing software or downloading the test data, send a tweet or an email to <a href="https://twitter.com/sethvanhooland">@sethvanhooland</a>.</p>
